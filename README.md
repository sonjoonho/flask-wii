Flask Wii
===================

# Overview

A flask web application that emulates the features of a Wii controller with just a mobile device. Inspired by: [web-riimote](https://github.com/konaraddio/web-riimote)

I saw web riimote and I had been practicing flask recently so why not.

# Getting started

This app uses pipenv.

Run 

```
pipenv install -e .
pipenv run python run.py
```


TODO verify this command haha
