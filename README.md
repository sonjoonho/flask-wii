# Flask Wii


## Overview

A Flask web application that emulates the features of a Wii controller with just a mobile device. Inspired by: [web-riimote](https://github.com/konaraddio/web-riimote)

I saw web riimote and I had been practicing flask recently so why not.

## Getting started

You can test this app at http://flask-wii.herokuapp.com

Alternatively, you can run it locally.

This project uses Pipenv for dependency management.

To run:

```
pipenv install -e .
pipenv run python run.py
```
